# Help-Map (Dopomoga)

Here we try to develop a tool that can help people to find whom to help if they have a chance to do that.

## Plan

### Front-end

Next.js application with bing maps

### Backend-end

Backend yet to be defined

### Database

Right now I am evaluating DynamoDB as a primary database to keep master data.

### Infrastructure

For now  the primary candidate for infrastructure is AWS.
